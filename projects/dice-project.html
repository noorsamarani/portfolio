        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>DICE is a <strong>user oriented</strong> ticketing app where music fans can search, browse and buy tickets for upcoming gigs, concerts and festivals.</p>
        <p>DICE’s algorithms offer a tailor-made selection of events for each user, and helps them discover something new every week. Plus they can sync their Spotify or Apple Music account and never miss their favourite artists.</p>
        <p>It’s not for nothing that DICE was awarded <strong>Best Ticketing Company</strong> in the 2016 Music Week Awards.</p>
        <p><strong>Their mission : Get people out more and make sure they have an incredible night out.</strong></p>
        <p>However, can we say that their mission is really accomplished?</p>

    <div class="container small-container">
      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>DICE makes the pre-purchase and purchase stages as smooth as it could be. But what about the <strong>post-purchase</strong> stage? What about the event itself?</p>
      <p>After interviewing 7 outgoing fans, and being a passionate music fan myself, I can confirm that even <strong>the best of events</strong> can very quickly turn into a <strong>nightmare</strong>.</p>
      <p>Overcrowded concerts, never-ending queues, drunken fights, loosing your group of friends and spending a whole festival alone…</p>
      <p><strong>How can DICE accompany its users during the events to make sure they have the best experience possible?</strong></p>
<br>
      <h2>Users & Audience</h2>
      <p>Our users are <strong>outgoing music lovers</strong>: devoted fans, party animals, festival-goers, concert addicts, music purists or simply musically curious people.</p>
      <p>They are using both iOS or Android and living across various cities in the United Kingdom and Ireland (including London, Manchester, Bristol, Cardiff, Brighton, Leeds, Newcastle, Birmingham, Glasgow and Dublin), San Francisco, Los Angeles or Paris.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Roles & Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>Being a UX/UI Designer, this was a personal project which I decided to work on during the lockdown due to Covid-19 — at a point where I missed going to concerts a little bit too much.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Scope & Constraints</h2>
      <p>This project being totally independent of DICE and having no contact with the team whatsoever, I had to work with the means at hand to gather the data needed and understand the brand’s essence:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Internet research about DICE</p></li>
        <li><p>Thorough analysis DICE’s website and app to better define its identity</p></li>
        <li><p>Competitors analysis</p></li>
        <li><p>Users and music fans interviews</p></li>
      </ul></p>
      <br>
      <h2>Process</h2>

      <p class="quote text-center font-italic text-muted">“Getting out more makes us feel good. It lets us fully experience the city we live in. It connects us to a community. And it gives us memories that last.” - DICE</p>

      <p>Being a wanderer of concert venues myself, I couldn’t agree more.
However, I couldn’t help but think of the few bad memories that I wish I’d forget, and thought that I should investigate a little further to find the sources of these bad experiences.
I decided to interview 7 music fans about their worst experiences at events, concerts and festivals, here are the main pain points that came up multiple times:</p>
<ol><li><p>The never-ending queues, to get in, at the bar, for the toilets, to get food…</p></li>

<p class="quote text-center font-italic text-muted">“Sometimes it felt like I spent more time queuing than listening to music.”</p>

<li><p>Drunken fights</p></li>

<p class="quote text-center font-italic text-muted">“I honestly don’t remember much… Except that it hurt.”</p>

<li><p>Loosing your belongings or getting robbed</p></li>

<p class="quote text-center font-italic text-muted">“I lost my phone, my keys and my coat... Basically everything.”</p>

<li><p>Loosing all of your friends and having no way to contact them because no service, no wifi or no battery</p></li>

<p class="quote text-center font-italic text-muted">“I spent the whole festival alone.”</p>

</ol>
<p>I decided to face one problem at a time, and to first focus on this last pain point.
I then conducted a competitors analysis, and divided my findings into 3 categories :</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>The apps with features to <strong>discover</strong> events in your town, like Bandsintown, Le Bonbon, Facebook and Spotify.</p></li>
  <li><p>The apps to <strong>purchase</strong> tickets, like Ticketmaster, Digitick and Ticketswap.</p></li>
  <li><p>The apps dedicated to <strong>help users in hopeless moments</strong> like Find my friends, Triber, and FireChat, to chat without data or wifi.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>My goal was to add a new feature in the app that would help lost users communicate and find their friends when needed to position DICE in the middle of these 3 categories.</p>

    </figure>
  <div class="container small-container">
<p>After conducting a <strong>Crazy 8s</strong> remotely with the help of 2 fellow UX/UI Designers, here is the idea we decided to develop: create different features adapted to a specific need and situation to help the lost users find their friends in different ways.</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>A <strong>map</strong> to visualise the location of the users’ friends that are at the same event and that they already follow on the app.</p> </li>
  <li><p>A <strong>compass</strong>, more adapted and precise to locate them in crowds.</p></li>
  <li><p>A <strong>coloured signal light</strong> appearing on both the user’s and the tracked person’s phones, for them to hold up their phones and spot each other easier when they are getting closer in crowds.</p></li>
  <li><p>A <strong>talkie-walkie</strong>, using peer-to-peer technology to communicate without data or internet.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I integrated these new features to the app by following DICE’s brand guidelines and identity.</p>

<p>And created new icons in the same graphic style and added touches of micro-interactions to look alike the icons that already exist on the app.</p>

  <h2>Outcomes & Lessons</h2>
<p>After conducting 5 usability tests and gathering interesting insights, here are the next steps I defined :</p>
<p><strong>Mid-term</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li> <p>Replace the Talkie feature by a chat without internet connection, “voice messages” not being the best communication tool in loud environments.</p> </li>
  <li> <p>Add another entry point to these features.</p> </li>
  <li> <p>And of course iterate usability test with new users.</p> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Long-term</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li> <p>Develop a feature to avoid wasting so much time queuing</p> </li>
  <li> <p>Continue focusing on improving the fans’ experiences at the events</p> </li>
</ul>

<p>This project was made for fun during my free time and wasn't made in collaboration with DICE.</p>
